# faster-whisper model: tiny | base | small | medium | large-v3 | large-v3-turbo
# Default is "large-v3-turbo": large-v3 with the decoder pruned 32->4 layers,
# ~8x faster than large-v3 at near-large-v3 accuracy, and it keeps every
# language (unlike distil-whisper / Parakeet, which drop Arabic). On GPU it's
# also faster than "small" while transcribing much better — pure win for the
# live-captioning case. CPU users should drop to "small" or "base" in the popup.

#              those aren't present, so it's safe to select either way.
#   "none"   — pass the transcript through untranslated
# Default is "nllb": local, offline, no per-sentence network hop, stronger

# so this default is safe even before the one-time NLLB setup completes.

# because word order / agreement (especially in Arabic) need the whole clause.
#
# Instead we accumulate raw transcript across chunks and only translate +
# display when the buffer looks like a complete thought: it ends in sentence
# punctuation, a speech pause (silence chunk) ends the utterance, or one of the
# bounds below trips so latency stays capped even mid-monologue.
